# The Lost Chef
This app is a flask app about different cuisines from around the world . It has three world class cuisines : Japanese , Moroccan and Spanish. Each cuisine has a certain dish and when each dish is opened the ingredients and the method is shown. This app allows the users to register and login so that they will be able to share their ideas by adding , editing or deleting their recipes.

# UX
This website is mainly for users who are looking for world class cuisines to make , the cuisine section is divided into three cuisines Japanese cuisine , Moroccan cuisine and Spanish cuisine and each cuisine has a very famous dish to make .

Below are a couple of User experiences upon which the app was built:
1. As a foodaholic, I would like to share my ideas and different ways to make certain dishes/recipes.
2. As a foodaholic, I would like the description to include both the ingredients and method.
3. As a user, I would like to be the only one who can delete / update / edit  my entries and also access my entries easier.

# Features:

# existing Features-
Navbar- allows the user to go to different parts of the website by clicking the section they want to access.
About- gives the user an idea about me (the author).  
Cuisines- this is where the different types of cuisines are including their ingredients and methods.
Register section allows the user to create an account which will give them the ability to login and start making entries, edit / delete them too.
Once logged in, the user can find their entries on a dashboard in which they can make changes or enter new ones. The dashboard is personalized to each user when they login as it shows "weclome (username)".
There is a logout button too, which only appears if the user is logged in. Just like the dashboard.
When the user chooses to logout, their entries are then shown along with the cuisines available on the app and can be accessed.
Each user can: enter, delete and edit the recipes.

# Technologies used
In this project I have concentrated on using MySQL and python.
MySQL is a relational database management system based on SQL â€“ Structured Query Language.
Python was used for developing desktop GUI application, website and web application. Also, Python, as a high level programming language, allows you to focus on core functionality of the application by taking care of common programming tasks.
HTML5 and JavaScript were also used to write the code for the webpages.
CSS framework - bootstrap was used for the layout of the app.

# Testing
This app was tested by inspecting it and using responsinator.com , Contents of my flask app are fully visible on all screen sizes.

I also tested it by creating multiple accounts and entering new recipes, editing and deleting them to see how the app responds.

Contents of my flask app are fully visible on all screen sizes.


# Deployment
The process of deploying the project to GitHub was as follows:
1.  successfully pushing the files to GitHub ,start the deployment.
2. I went on settings and to the page section, changed the branch name to Master Branch.
3. A link was operated and that was the Live URL to my website.
Deployment: is making the website Live and accessible by anyone who opens the link provided.
Development: is using Git commands to upload the file used in the making of the website to GitHub in order to be downloaded or viewed by the assesor and checked.
To run my code locally, and ensure that it perfectly works, the user should download the source files used along with the HTML code and run it on their device.
